        Indiaâ€™s struggle for Independence is written in the pages of history by the sweat, blood, and sacrifice of
        millions of Indians who took up the Swadeshi and the Non-Co-operation movement led by the Visionary leader
        Mahatma Gandhi.<br>The Spinning Wheel or Charkha became not only a symbol of the revolution, but it now is a
        symbol synonymous with the power of self-reliance, perseverance, and determination. From then to now the Charkha
        has initiated an upheaval and marked the path of progress for the Indian Spinning Industry.
