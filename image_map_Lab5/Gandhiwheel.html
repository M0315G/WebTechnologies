            Indiaâ€™s struggle for Independence is written in the pages of history by the sweat, blood, and sacrifice of
            millions of Indians who took up the Swadeshi and the Non-Co-operation movement led by the Visionary leader
            Mahatma Gandhi.<br>The Spinning Wheel or Charkha became not only a symbol of the revolution, but it now is a
            symbol synonymous with the power of self-reliance, perseverance, and determination. From then to now the
            Charkha
            has initiated an upheaval and marked the path of progress for the Indian Spinning Industry.<br><br>
            <center><b>The Wheel that Spun History:</b></center><br>The spinning wheel has significance from the ancient
            times.
            The women of the household used to spin cloth as a part of their daily activity, it used to be a part of
            their dowry. During the rule of the East India Company, the British used to ship the raw cotton from India
            to England and the finished material would come back to India to be sold at exorbitant prices, thus causing
            Indian farmers and commoners to suffer from huge losses and poverty.

            Mahatma Gandhi initiated the Swadeshi movement by taking up the charkha and encouraging the Indians to spin
            their own cloth. The cloth woven from the Spinning Wheel is known as Khadhi or Khaddar, meaning course
            cloth. The charkha became a symbol of self-sufficiency and freedom, so much so that the first Indian flag
            designed had the Charkha etched in the middle which was later replaced by the Ashok Chakra. This marked the
            beginning of the Indian Spinning Industry which has evolved through the years to reach the economic zenith
            that it has now achieved.
